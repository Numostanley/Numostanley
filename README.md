### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Numo-Stanley Nanatei, and I am a proficient back-end engineer who has a passion for creating quality software solutions. With several years of experience, I have developed an excellent understanding of object-oriented programming, data wrangling, and the fundamental underpinnings of a product or software development lifecycle.

I possess an analytical and problem-solving mindset, the ability to learn quickly, a solid understanding of fundamental design principles, and exceptional communication skills. Throughout my career, I have designed and implemented scalable and maintainable code using common design patterns in software engineering.

I have deployed and managed applications on cloud services, utilized version control and task scheduling tools, and containerized applications using Docker for deployment to production. I am constantly seeking to learn and grow in my career, and I am committed to delivering the highest quality results that exceed expectations.
