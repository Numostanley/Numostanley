My name is Numo-Stanley Nanatei, and I am a Python developer and backend engineer with a passion for creating quality software solutions. With 3 years of experience, I have developed an excellent understanding of object-oriented programming, data wrangling, and the fundamental underpinnings of a product or software development lifecycle. 

My skills and proficiencies include data analytics using Python, NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, as well as back-end technologies like Python (Django), REST APIs, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I possess an analytical and problem-solving mindset, the ability to learn quickly, and exceptional communication skills. I also have ample experience with front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript and a solid understanding of fundamental design principles. Additionally, I have knowledge of cloud services like Digital Ocean and AWS, an understanding of Linux system administration, and a working knowledge of Docker. 

I am constantly seeking to learn and grow in my field, and I am committed to delivering the highest quality results to my clients.
